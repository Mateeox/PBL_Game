1.
	"OHMMMMMMMMMMM"
	
	(The hell is goint on? Where am I?)
	
	"Are you awake? Very well. You will gain a peivilege of being a sacrifice for great Apgarion."
	
	(For who?)
	
2.
	"Go."
	
	(They pushed me inside dark house and closed doors behind me. I took out flashlight from pocket.)
	
	(Then I looked at wall and noticed big stain of blood. It frightened me so much that i dropped the flashlight.)
	
	GHHRHRHRRHH
	
3.
	(When i looked at the sound source, I noticed black hand and... this.)
	
	(The aura around this... monster was like from horror. It wasnt human.)
	
	(In this screwed up situation, this was the only thing I was sure of.)
	
	(I ran away.)
	
	(Then...)
	
	CRACK
	
4.
	(I crashed into a  mirror that shattered into pieces.)
	
	(I started to run away again.)
	
	(After few minutes of ruuning I noticed i ended in the same room.)
	
	(Monster's noises disappeared. I decided to catch a breath.)
	
	(Then I noticed that my reflection in mirror shard was not correct.)
	
	"...the hell?"
	
	(On the other side of the mirror was second dimension looking like mine, but not dependent.)
	
	GHRHRHRHRRRRRR
	
	Damn, no time to thinking.
	
	(I hid shard in my pocket and continued running.)
	
	GHRRRR
	
	Are you looking for me? Good, let's make use of it.
	
	(During running i noticed a lot of items that would be useful in creating a trap.)
	
	So it shall be. You try to kill me? Don't complain if I do the same.
